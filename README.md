# IceCreamManufacturingDBMS
A single report.pdf file that outlines the steps taken to design an ice cream manufacturing relational database and accompanying DBMS.
## The report outlines the following:
- An ER diagram that defines the relationship between locations that manufacture ingredients required for ice cream dessert  
  creation and customers who can place orders for these ingredients from particular locations.
- SQL queries with equivalent RA queries included in the report for testing purposes of the database's logical structure and examples of data retrieval on the part of the user.
- Normalization steps followed to ensure that the tables aligned with the conceptual schema outlined by the ER diagram are in BCNF format.
- Screen shots depicting various types of terminal based use cases that users can invoke to manage the data contained in the database as a way to provide the functionality required by a DBMS.
